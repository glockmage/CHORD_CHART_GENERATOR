# CHORD CHART GENERATOR
 This is an IntelliJ Java Program that generates chord charts based on the desired keys/chords/tunings
 This project is primarily for my own use.
 Eventually, I hope to port this project over to a web-based application (likely in JavaScript).
 Before that, I want to get the program functional since I am unfamiliar with JS.
